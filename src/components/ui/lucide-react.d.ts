import { LucideProps } from 'lucide-react';

// Re-export all named exports from 'lucide-react'
export * from 'lucide-react';

// If there are specific icons you want to add or override, you can do it here.
// For example, to add a custom 'Fish' icon if it were missing:
// export const Fish: React.FC<LucideProps>;

// By default, this file will just re-export everything, ensuring type safety.
